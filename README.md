	<h1> Control Theory</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">Control theory</a> is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with the design of control policies for actuated dynamical systems. Control engineering is a cross-discipline field that applies control theory to a wide range of systems such as industrial plants, aerospace, robotics and more.
